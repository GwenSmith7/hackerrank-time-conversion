My solution for the Time Conversion challenge on HackerRank. I've only included the function I needed to create.

Overview of Challenge:

Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
